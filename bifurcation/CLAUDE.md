We're researching the phenomenon of bifurcation in shallow multi level perceptrons (MLPs).
In particular, we're interested in pitchfork bifurcation during training time: When training a shallow multilayer perceptron (MLP) via gradient descent with a very small weight initialization standard deviation ($\alpha \to 0$), the network's weights sometimes exhibit a phenomenon known as **bifurcation**. The weights initially collapse onto a single 1-dimensional line, temporarily plateau in loss, and then suddenly "unzip" or bifurcate into two or more distinct branches to more fully match the target function's features.

* Use `uv run python ...` to run Python commands
* You can use the existing tool in the shallow_mlps folder (`uv run python -m shallow_mlps.cli`) to experiment with shallow MLPs and generate plots of their behavior
* The paradigm your research is in is called "Learning mechanics". At the beginning of any exploration or theory writing task, please review the file `there_will_be_a_scientific_theory_of_deep_learning.pdf` in your workspace to understand the overarching goal behind your research, and to grasp the spirit and style in which it should be presented.

We know that the following custom function works well for illustrating the phenomenon: 'x[1] + x[2] + abs(x[1]) + abs(x[2])' (the equivalent of $ReLU(x_1) + ReLU(x_2)$)
As can be seen in the `scatterplot.gif` / `scatterplot.png` resulting from:
```bash
uv run python -m shallow_mlps.cli run --target-type custom --width 500 --input-dim 2 --alpha 0.00000001 --lr 0.01 --activation relu --steps 10000 --snapshot-interval 500 --custom-expr 'x[1] + x[2] + abs(x[1]) + abs(x[2])' --output-dir <...>
```
